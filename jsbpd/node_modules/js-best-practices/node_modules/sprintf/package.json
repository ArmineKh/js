See Disclaimer above.**\n\n    npm install sprintf\n\n\n## How to\n\nWorks exactly like http://www.diveintojavascript.com/projects/javascript-sprintf, except that it exports those two functions:\n\n    sprintf = require('sprintf').sprintf;\n    vsprintf = require('sprintf').vsprintf;\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n## Copyright/License\n\nCopyright (c) 2007-2013, Alexandru Marasteanu <hello [at) alexei (dot] ro>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n  notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n  documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n* Neither the name of this software nor the names of its contributors may be\n  used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without\n  specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
